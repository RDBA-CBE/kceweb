These groups meet frequently to analyze what they have studied the previous week or what they have read in the library or maybe to discuss an issue if anyone in the group faces one. Members of these groups make regular presentations on current topics. The faculty member will closely monitor all the activities of the group attached to him and mentor them. This helps the students shed their inhibitions, develop communication skills and become good public speakers and communicators.
